### backup
oc project TARGET_PROJECT

### Confirm current volume mount information
$ oc set volume dc jenkins
deploymentconfigs/jenkins
  pvc/jenkins-data (allocated 10GiB) as jenkins-data
    mounted at /var/lib/jenkins

### Make sure to stop application and no write during backup
$ oc scale dc jenkins --replicas=0

### Spawn no-op container for the storage maintenance
oc run sleep --image=registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7 -- tail -f /dev/null

### Mount PVC to that container
oc set volume dc sleep --add -t pvc --name=jenkins-data --claim-name=jenkins-data --mount-path=/var/lib/jenkins

### (Optional) rsh into the container and make tar.gz archive
### You can skip this step if you want to rsync the data directly, or no disk space available for the tar.gz archive
oc rsh sleep-X-XXXXX
mkdir /tmp/backup
cd /tmp/backup
tar czf data.tar.gz -C /var/lib/jenkins/ .
exit

### rsync data from the pod
oc rsync sleep-X-XXXXX:/tmp/backup .

### Restart application pod and remove maintenance pod if needed
oc scale dc jenkins --replicas=1
oc delete dc sleep

## restore
oc project TARGET_PROJECT

### Confirm current volume mount information
$ oc set volume dc jenkins
deploymentconfigs/jenkins
  pvc/jenkins-data (allocated 10GiB) as jenkins-data
    mounted at /var/lib/jenkins

### Make sure to stop application and no write during backup
$ oc scale dc jenkins --replicas=0

### Spawn no-op container for the storage maintenance

### Mount PVC to that container
oc set volume dc sleep --add -t pvc --name=jenkins-data --claim-name=jenkins-data --mount-path=/var/lib/jenkins

### rsync data to the pod
oc rsync ./backup sleep-X-XXXXX:/tmp/

### rsh into the container and restore backup
oc rsh sleep-X-XXXXX
cd /var/lib/jenkins
tar xf /tmp/backup/data.tar.gz
exit

### Restart application pod and remove maintenance pod if needed
oc scale dc jenkins --replicas=1
oc delete dc sleep
